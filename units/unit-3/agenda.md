# Unit 3 Agenda

## A-Side

:rabbit: Easter Break (no class) :rabbit:

## B-Side

> Note: for students in Section 40, we will cover this material in person during class on Wednesday 4/4. For students in Section 41, you are expected to cover this material independently/remotely in a "flipped" manner, and this effort will be counted in place of what would otherwise have been Unit 7B.

  + Code Simplification and [Refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DefinitionOfRefactoring.html) - "Do not Repeat Yourself" (DRY)
  + Visual Basic Programming:
    + [Custom Sub-procedures](/notes/visual-basic/sub-procedures/notes.md)
    + [Custom Functions](/notes/visual-basic/functions/notes.md)
    + [Modules and Architecture](/notes/visual-basic/modules/notes.md)
  + Ungraded practice exercise: can you use custom functions and sub-procedures to simplify and remove duplication from the code you submitted as part of your [ActiveX Controls Assignment](/assignments/activex-controls/assignment.md), specifically for the option button and check box challenges?
