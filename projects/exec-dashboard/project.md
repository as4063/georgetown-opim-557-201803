# Executive Dashboard

Assume you own and operate a startup online retail business. At monthly board meetings, you meet with your top investors and advisors to discuss the company's strategic direction, set priorities, and allocate resources. To aid this decision-making process, the board has requested you provide them with a monthly summary report of business insights, including the aggregation of total sales and identification of top-selling products.

Luckily, at the end of each calendar month, the online platform your company uses to sell its products makes available for download from its admin interface a CSV file representing all individual sales orders for that month. But usually you only have a few hours from when the data becomes available to when you are required to turn it around and share the resulting insights with the board. Over the past few months, this report compilation process has been somewhat stressful and vulnerable to manual error. And the board's confidence in your operational leadership is dependent not only on your ability to meet sales goals, but also on your ability to provide them with accurate and timely information.

So your objective is to create a tool which automates the process of transforming monthly sales data into a report of business insights. This report should be formatted as a data dashboard which utilizes charts and graphs to tell a compelling story.

## Learning Objectives

  1. Design and build a tool to automate manual efforts and aid a decision-making process.
  2. Find practical applications for learning new programming concepts, primarily importing data from CSV files.

## Instructions

Create a new macro-enabled workbook named **`netid`-exec-dash.xlsm**, where `netid` is your university-issued net identifier (i.e. the first part of your university-issued email address).
