# Contributor's Guide

Anyone with a GitHub account can propose changes to files in this repository.

This document describes instructions and best practices for contributing to this repository. If you are a student unfamiliar with GitHub, feel free to [consult the guides](https://guides.github.com/) and/or ask the professor for a crash course.

## Fork the Repository

Fork the course repository via the GitHub.com online interface to create a copy under the ownership of your own GitHub user. After doing so, you should be able to view your fork online at `https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/georgetown-opim-557-201803`.

## Revise File Contents

To revise content, navigate to a file in your forked repository via the GitHub.com online interface, then click the "pencil" icon to reveal an online text editor. When done editing a file, "commit" to save the changes. After doing so, you should be able to view your changes reflected online in your own fork.

> NOTE: Most files in this repository are written in a syntax called Markdown. For reference, see this [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf).

## Submit a Pull Request

After your fork contains the changes you'd like to be included in the course repository, navigate to the original course repository and create a Pull Request (PR) using the GitHub.com online interface. In the PR message, describe what changes you made and why.

The professor should review your PR within a timely manner. If the professor accepts your changes, he will merge them into the course repository's master branch, at which point you should be able to view your changes reflected in the course repository. Else if there are issues with the submission, the instructor should provide further instruction by commenting on the PR, and may close it.

Congratulations! :clap: Thanks! :pray:
