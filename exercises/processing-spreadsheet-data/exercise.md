# Processing Spreadsheet Data

## Challenge

Write a VBA program that will allow the user to select any one of the [example spreadsheet files](data/) representing historical market returns. The program should import the contents of the "Data" sheet from the selected spreadsheet file into a similarly-named sheet in the program's workbook. Finally, the program should calculate the average, min, and max rate based on data contained within the file, and display the results in a message box.
