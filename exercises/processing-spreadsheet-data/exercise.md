# Processing Spreadsheet Data

> Thanks to Professor Dillon-Merrill for providing the data files used in this exercise.

## Challenge

Write a VBA program that will allow the user to select any one of the [example spreadsheet files](data/) representing historical market returns. For any of these files, assume the first sheet is named "Data", and the first two columns of data on that sheet represent years and annual investment return rates, respectively.

The program should import the contents of the "Data" sheet from the selected spreadsheet file into a similarly-named sheet in the program's workbook. Finally, the program should calculate the average, min, and max rates based on data contained within the file, and display the results in a message box.
